    <string name="help_2">Shopping List has two modes - shopping mode (turned on by default) and edit mode.\nShopping mode is designed as an interactive version of traditional shopping list.

    <string name="help_6">Calendar allows you to plan your meals for any day, and then automatically generate the shopping list!\nPress any day to access menu which lets you assign any existing recipe to this day, or create a new one.</string>
    <string name="help_7">When you already assigned recipes to the days, you can generate the shopping list.\nTap the "Select days for list" option in upper-right corner of the screen. Now, you can just select the first day and last day, then tap "Generate List" (again, in upper-right corner of the screen).\nIt is done! Just navigate back to Shopping List screen to see all the things you have to buy.</string>
